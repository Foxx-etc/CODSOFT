To_do_list.py is a python file which Saves The Task You Would Like To Work On

It's a Command Line Interface which may seems to be boring but I made it Interactive and Easy

Everytime the display gets clear to Make it look Visually Better

It Store Task, Remove the task, to store what tasks are completed, and Show the pending and completed tasks
